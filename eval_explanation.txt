Evaluation Function
-------------------

Evaluation function for depth limited minimax is implemented to calculate the utility value.

Calculation of Utility Value from the evaluation function : 

The higher the utility value then better is the decision of the computer in selecting the respective column.

First it checks for whether it can make a four, then it checks subsequently for threes and then twos. Similarly it checks for the highest possible four of the opponent and the formuala is given below :-

utility_value = (my_fours * 10 + my_threes * 5 + my_twos * 2)- (opp_fours *10 + opp_threes * 5 + opp_twos * 2).
After calculating all utility values, the highest value and the corresponding column mapped to it is selected and then the move is predicted.
